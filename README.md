# Environment

This repo contains config files and setup scripts for several critical parts of my development environment.
Its only assumption is that ZSH is available on the system.

Currently it automates:
* Setting ZSH as the default shell, installing the 'Oh My ZSH' framework, replacing .zshrc with the one in this repo, and setting the ZSH_CUSTOM directory
* Installing homebrew and several of my most commonly installed packages (and casks)
* Installing git, setting the git config & global gitignore file
